Since the OpenWeather API needs co-ordinates (latitude and longitude) these first needed to be gathered. However, after trying to use the OpenWeather geolocation and being unable to return anything, I instead used an API from API Ninjas (found in sources below). This only needed a text input, gathered from the local storage saved city, to return the data, the co-ordinates from which were saved to variables.
